**Step 3: Verify your API key secret**

Go to your repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Confirm there is a secret named exactly `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Capital letters, underscores — must match exactly.

If it's missing, you need an Anthropic API key from `console.anthropic.com` and add it there.

**Step 4: Confirm GitHub App repo access**

Go to your **GitHub org or account → Settings → Integrations → GitHub Apps → Claude**

Confirm it shows your FRC repo in the list of repositories it has access to. If not, click Configure and add it.

**Step 5: Test**

Once the workflow file is committed to your **default branch** (usually `main`), open an issue and comment:
```
